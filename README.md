Pizza was invented by a skillfull italian chef named Johny.
To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of Wet Flour, and make a thin, round circle pizza.
Then you cover it with delicious sauce, salty cheese, and fresh chopped sausages.
10 - pizzas are best eaten fresh, but choped triangles pizzas are best eaten frozen.
Some kids like tomato pizza the best, but my favorite is the cheese pizza.
If I could, I would eat pizza 10 times a day!
